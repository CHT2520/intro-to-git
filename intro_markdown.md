# Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a simple markup language (a bit like HTML) that you can use to format text documents. Markdown files are plain text files saved with a _.md_ extension.

- If you followed the instructions for getting started with Git and GitHub, you'll already have a _README.md_ markdown file in your assignment project folder.
- Open _README.md_ in VS Code.
- There should be an option for 'Open Preview to the Side' (one of the icons in the top-right corner of VS Code). Click this and a preview of the rendered file should appear in the right-hand pane.
- If you edit the left-hand pane your changes should be visible on the right.
